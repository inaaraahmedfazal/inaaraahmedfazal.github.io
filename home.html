<p> Hello, and welcome to my portfolio website! My name is Inaara, and I am a Biomedical Engineering student entering my second year at the University of Waterloo. I am a creative problem-solver with experience working on group and individual projects in a variety of settings. I work hard, and am always willing to try new things. I am currently seeking an internship for the summer in software development, web development, or research. Thanks for visiting my portfolio site - please click on the links at the top of the page to view descriptions of my experience!
